Second Hackson Demo
===================

This is my first time to attend the real hackson event --  **[BattleHack](https://2015.battlehack.org)** hold by PayPal company in Tokyo. It is the first time in Tokyo, and it is a 2-day hackson event, and you have a 24-hours to finish your demo, and to do the presentation within 2 minutes. The rule is simple, just one thing to use the PayPal API in your project, whatever it is and done.
 
The entrance is like this:

The environment was really awesome. Foods, Drinks, Music, Massage, really cool. The stuffs were all nice people, and the attendees were all friendly, when you checked their projects, some of demos were really cool.     

But what a pity was, I was solo again..., actually speaking, I was semi-solo, because I had a teamate at the first day, and he went home back in the middle night at the first day.

## Installation

### Installing Emacs 24

Obviously to use the Emacs Prelude you have to install Emacs 24
first. Have a look at the [WikEmacs articles on installing Emacs](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Installing_Emacs).  

After you install the original Emacs 24, and **Do Not Open It** and execute the steps below.

### Installing Modified Prelude 

```bash
cd ~
export PRELUDE_URL="https://github.com/hanks/prelude.git" && curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh
```

## Run
At this time, just open Emacs and wait, and it will do the configuration automatically. Then Happy Coding!
