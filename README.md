Second Hackson Demo
===================

This is my first time to attend the real hackson event --  **[BattleHack](https://2015.battlehack.org)** hold by PayPal company in Tokyo. It is the first time in Tokyo, and it is a 2-day hackson event, and you have a 24-hours to finish your demo, and to do the presentation within 2 minutes. The rule is simple, just one thing to use the PayPal API in your project, whatever it is and done.
 
The entrance is like this:

The environment was really awesome. Foods, Drinks, Music, Massage, really cool. The stuffs were all nice people, and the attendees were all friendly, when you checked their projects, some of demos were really cool.

But what a pity was, I was solo again..., actually speaking, I was semi-solo, because I had a teammate at the first day, and he went home back in the middle night. Whatever, I enjoyed this event:

## Idea
This time, I use iBeacon again, and the theme of project is charity, to help people to donate for the local environment development when they travel. And to let charity activities more close to people, and make people to do charity more positive after they experience the fun traveling.
